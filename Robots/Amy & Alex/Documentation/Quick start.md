The robot makes a sound when it starts.

Wait for the floating robot to appear, this means the software is loading. Once a button with chinese text appears in the bottom right corner the software is ready to use, simply press the screen.

Before using the navigation, the map must be restored.

::: info
To turn the robot **off**, simply hold the power switch for about 5 seconds.
