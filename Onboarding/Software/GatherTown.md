# Welcome to Techlabs on GatherTown!

The GatherTown Techlabs layout starts to the North where you enter. Directly south ⬇️ in the middle is the Big Meeting room that dominates the overall layout.

To the west ⬅️ is your workplace (AWB style) with a large social room just below, there you can play online poker, chat and hangout.

On the east wing ➡️ is your outdoor area with a fountain⛲ and a small sandy beach 🏖️ . And finally down at the bottom of the map is a relaxing (🧘‍♂️ Zen) area with 🐡 koi fishes and the sound of running water.

Feel free to come here anytime and hold your meetings or just hangout with friends.

We hope you will enjoy your stay!
