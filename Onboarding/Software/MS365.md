Even if we are actively trying to move away from Microsoft office suite, as it is proprietary, it is still a large tool that looms over all of us and our colleagues due to necessary work contacts.

As such, Techlabs in no way prohibit the use of the Microsoft Office Tools, in fact a lot of internal communication still happens over Teams (*atleast until ðŸš€ rocket.chat or other alternative gets up and running*). Hence you will often find that we keep duplicating files on both Teams and NextCloud to ensure everyone is onboard.

Use Teams if you wish! Please upload relevant documentation also here as NextCloud remains central for our success at Techlabs!
