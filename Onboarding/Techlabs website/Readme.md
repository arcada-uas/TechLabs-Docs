TechLabs has its own website, check it out here:

<https://techlabs.fi/>

The website serves as our main tool for outwards publicity.

Simple posts just need a few lines of text and a photo or relevant imagery, the pressure to publish should be low to actively encourage posts and show that TechLabs is active.

*If you 🏅 accomplish something we'd want the world to know and with 🌐 TechLabs website we can!*

The website also hosts information of all TechLabs projects, labs and most importantly people, including you!

So read here on how to create 🖼️  [Your profile](../Techlabs%20website/Your%20profile.md) for the TechLabs website and once that is done, perhaps you want to introduce yourself with a small 📯  [post](../Techlabs%20website/Make%20a%20post.md)?
