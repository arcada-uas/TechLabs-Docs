*You have an idea 💡  or accomplishment 🏅 you want to share❓*

***Then here is how you get it on the Techlabs site❗***

To make a post you simple need a **text** and one image or video, it is that simple!

See below for more guidelines!

#### Text

Make your text about what it is you want to share. Short is never a problem, not quite a tweet, but a not a full paper either. Remember you can always link to longer publications, perhaps with a paragraph on your post enticing the reader to continue.

#### Photo

Have a photo, or an image (*or a video, see below*). This catches attention and helps promote you message. If you really want to spice it up generate an image using Techlabs and Opensource tools like [Stable Diffusion](https://stablediffusionweb.com/), don't know how? Getting in touch with admin, we will help!

Oh, and please make sure your image is not copyright protected, either by providing your own image or photo or by using an image under the [creative commons license](https://creativecommons.org/).

#### Videos

You can host shorter videos on the website as well, however for larger media we'd recommend uploading it to another source.
