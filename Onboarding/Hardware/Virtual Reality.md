# Virtual reality

At Techlabs we do research in virtual reality for consumer learning, robot simulations and virtual interactions. To do this we obviously need virtual reality hardware and apart from 2 specific virtual reality 💻 [Computers](Computers.md?fileId=27143) we also have some virtual headsets.

* Valve Index
* Varjo VR 2
* Playstation VR
* Hololens 2

### Playstation VR

The 🕹️ [Gaming Console](Gaming%20Consoles.md) Playstation 4 has an easy to use VR Headset. The scope for research is limited but the headset works well for certain demos or for users to try out lighter VR activities to train themselves against VR sickness or fatigue.

::: info
Virtual reality sickness, or VR sickness occurs when exposure to a virtual environment causes symptoms that are similar to motion sickness symptoms. - Wikipedia

## Hololens 2

While technically not a virtual reality the Hololens 2 available at Techlabs is a Microsoft made augmented reality headset, projecting virtual objects on the real world for users to interact with.

The Hololens 2 is breaking new and unexplored boundaries and as such any research suggestions for use with the Hololens 2 is much appriciated.
