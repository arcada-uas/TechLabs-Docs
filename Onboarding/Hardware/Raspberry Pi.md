At Techlabs we have several different models of Raspberry Pi. This document lists the available models and their common usecases.

Most are available for use in different projects, simply grab an unused micro-SD card and get your project up and going.

* The model 400 is a Raspberry Pi 4B (4gb) mounted inside a keyboard.
* Works for any normal project or as a all-in-one pc.

## Model 3B

* The previous model of Raspberry Pi and most readily available.
* Works for most projects and is especially suitable for less taxing projects like monitoring using sensors or as interactive info screens.
