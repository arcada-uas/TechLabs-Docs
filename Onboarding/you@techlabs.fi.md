As you sign your contract at TechLabs you should request access to your own @techlabs.fi e-mail.

The main purpose of the @techlabs.fi e-mail address is for signing up to some of the tools we use here at Techlabs, like [Bitwarden](./Software/Bitwarden.md)

::: info
*You can view and send your emails from the Email app right here on nextcloud*

*If the app tells you to "set up your inbox" - Contact Dennis, he forgot to do it for you*
