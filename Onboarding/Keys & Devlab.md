🏚️ For physical space most students collaborating with Techlabs can gain access to DevLab (F364).

🔑 If you are a student already with a key at Arcada then the person signing your contract will take necessary steps to add additional access.

🔐 As you access DevLab your key gets logged, as any other location at Arcada. This makes you liable to make sure the door is locked once you leave.

::: warn
❗ Please remember that Devlab is a faculty of **Arcada University of Applied Science** and any theft or intentional vandalism falls under local laws; read more about Finnish laws on the Poliisi website >[here](https://poliisi.fi/en/theft-and-petty-theft)<.

♻️ If by accident you break something, please report it accordingly.  
**'*Insurance works for broken items, not forgotten items.'***

☕ Regarding vanishing; if you are prone to leaving your personal coffee cup behind at the end of a shift it has a tendency to disappear. Please do not be alarmed as Arcada's efficient cleaning service most likely transported your coffee cup upstairs to the staff dishwasher, you can usually find your cup in the leisure space in F4.

🧹 Even if we have efficient cleaning services please keep your workspace hygienic. Trashcans can be found in most rooms and washing your hands is the best way to prevent the spread of germs.
