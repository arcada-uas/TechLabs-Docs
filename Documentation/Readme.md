# Welcome to TechLabs NextCloud!

The purpose of NextCloud was to find a solution for a more dynamic and sustainable digital infrastructure and an approach that is not based solely on proprietary software. Robin and Jonas found and developed an opensource alternative called NextCloud that we are now ready to test. We will start on a small scale by moving the TechLbas conversations and file sharing from Teams to NextCloud. The Demos channel will also be moved to NextCloud.

We will start using only a few apps such as Collectives for documentation sharing and wiki, Files for file management and Deck for task tracking.

In this collective you will find some relevant documentation on how to use NextCloud, getting started and what are the essential apps.

## Something missing?

In case there is something missing in this documentation or you have something you would like to add you can submit a bug report and write down your feedback there and we will adres it as soon as we can.
