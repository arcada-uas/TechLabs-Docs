# Using the deck app

The Deck app can be used as a task management tool within your organization or a group.

## Main board

The **TechLabs General board** is visible for all users in TechLabs and will be the main board used to see the progress and task tracking.

## **What boards can I see?**

Based on the team you are in you will see also the team specific boards (Afora, Arogs. Cassiopeia, Demos, MÃ¤ri, Profi WP3, Tafidiai and TechLabs Website). Only the members in a specific group can see the specific board. You will already be added to groups by the TechLabs admin based on the project you are working on.

You will also have a **Personal board** which is only visible to you and a great way to keep track of your personal tasks.
