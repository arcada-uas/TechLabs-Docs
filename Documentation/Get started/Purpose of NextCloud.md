The purpose of NextCloud was to find a sustainable alternative to our digital infrastructure based on open sourcesoftware as a part of the DEMOS research project. Last year TechLabs mapped our needs and now have deployed a cloud platform called NextCloud  that we are now ready to test.

## Some of the tasks that NextCloud will be used for

**Conversations and files:**  
We will be moving our files and conversations over to the platform, but lets start small scale.  
We begin with migrating only the conversations and files from the Demos channel from the TechLabs team.

**Documentation:**  
We use a NextCloud app called Collectives for sharing documentation and structuring a wiki site.

**Task tracking:**  
We used Miro previously for tracking tasks within research projects. The  platform is closed source and the free version was limited.  
While the platform was functional, it was easily forgotten and maybe better suited for graphical tasks than for task tracking.  
We will now use NextCloud Deck for task tracking.

**Feedback?**  
If you have any feedback such as difficulties or questions, please send a bug report collective to write down the feedback or write a message to Heidi in Teams.
